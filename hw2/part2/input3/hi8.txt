FT941-4003	ft 14 mar 94 slovaks worry about jobs as political battle rages the crisis as meciar fights for survival after losing a parliamentary vote of no confidence	mr vladimir meciar slovakia s beleaguered prime minister begins what is expected to be a long and bitter battle for his political survival today when he hands in his government s resignation mr meciar who lost a parliamentary vote of no confidence on friday has already threatened to close down government by immediately pulling out all his ministers while in theory a new government could be appointed within days as is clearly the hope of president michal kovac disagreements within the opposition and stalling tactics by mr meciar and his movement for a democratic slovakia hzds could prolong the crisis parliament must also approve a date for early elections something it has not been able to agree on until now the next general election is not due before 1996 mr meciar who is aware of conflicting interests within the opposition which ranges from the strongly christian kdh on the right to the reformed communists in the party of the democratic left sdl has also thrown the cat among the pigeons by pushing for a general election in june this was rejected by parliament as impractical but the opposition then failed to muster enough support for its own motion calling for elections in november deputies representing the hungarian ethnic minority held back support in the hope of winning concessions for more autonomy the sdl will now try again on wednesday with another motion calling for elections in september october but it is by no means guaranteed it will win the 90 votes required in the 150 seat parliament the opposition could muster only 78 votes in support of its no confidence motion the hzds has also gathered more than the 350 000 signatures required for a petition to force a referendum on holding early elections and dismissing deputies who have switched party if the petition is accepted as legitimate president kovac must order a referendum within 30 days but even so elections are likely to be delayed it could take months before the situation is resolved a senior slovak official said privately yesterday such political uncertainty could not come at a worse time with the country facing serious economic difficulties that may require unpopular measures the economy remains deeply in recession unemployment already at 15 per cent of the workforce is rising fast and there may be renewed pressures for a devaluation none of this would make a transitional government very popular the problem is compounded by the lack of clear political alternatives opposition to mr meciar has been as much over his authoritarian style of governing as about policies none of the opposition parties has come up with a distinct political progamme for government focusing instead on piecemeal policies slovakia became independent almost against its own wishes on january 1993 having to build most of its institutions from scratch it was short of qualified personnel and its politicians had no experience of running an independent country this has made for highly personalised and unpredictable politics such as attempts to find a third way between capitalism and socialism that have since been abandoned but did not help the country s international image or encourage foreign investment meanwhile the past two years political infighting has alienated an increasing number of slovaks according to recent polls about half eligible voters do not intend to vote or do not know what to vote for younger voters are most disaffected though dissatisfaction is widespread they don t care they re just interested in power says a young biology student in bratislava a taxi driver berates the politicians constant wheeling and dealing and has no time for the parliament it s bad for business he says even officials are down hearted there s a big gap between what the government thinks and what the people think a provincial chief of police says less than two years after victory in the june 1992 elections and over a year after independence mr meciar s popularity has declined to around 15 per cent in opinion polls the government has been weakened by successive rows and defections culminating in the recent damaging public confrontation with the president independence has not brought the prosperity promised by politicians though it is now accepted as irreversible people are more worried about jobs and security but with every new twist in the political crisis the uncertainty deepens and prospects of economic recovery become more remote whatever happens it s going to take time it s a mess and its going to get worse before it gets better one diplomat said
