FT941-4000	ft 14 mar 94 lack of training shuts out poor	when president bill clinton first called for a special conference to discuss jobs and unemployment at the group of seven summit in tokyo last summer the us economy was still recovering only anaemically from the 1990 recession and unemployment stood at 7 per cent today as the conference convenes in detroit the jobless rate is 6 5 per cent despite a change in the method of calculation that makes the figure higher than under the old system comparing the us record with that of europe some us commentators have sneered at the purpose of the conference actually there is no global crisis there is only a european crisis scoffed mr robert samuelson in the magazine newsweek we have nothing to learn from the europeans about job creation and the lessons they could learn from us are the obvious ones that for political and social reasons they can t adopt clinton administration officials however have spent the last week telling anyone who would listen that on the contrary they still have a great deal to learn from them while the us has indeed had much more dynamic job creation than the other g7 countries they note real wages in the us have stagnated for years at the same time income disparities between the better trained and educated and the less well trained have widened dramatically whole segments of the population have been virtually shut out of the job market with unemployment approaching 70 per cent in some cases such as inner city black teenagers others could learn from us flexibility and dynamism we could learn from what others have done to facilitate the transition from school to work said mr larry summers the treasury undersecretary for international affairs looked at over a period of decades the us has consistently created new jobs at a strong pace the number of non farm jobs grew by an average of 2 2 per cent a year from 1950 to 1990 unemployment meanwhile oscillated between 4 9 per cent and 9 7 per cent in the 1970s and 1980s much lower than comparable european rates although some workers may give up the search for work quicker than they might in europe since us benefits stop after 26 weeks at the start of the 1990s employment stagnated as recession was followed by a slow recovery which seemed to bring few new jobs in its wake last year net job creation picked up to 1 8 per cent more robust but still weak by the standards of most post war recoveries a new study by economists steven davis john haltiwanger and scott schuh at the census bureau s centre for economic studies shows that the gross creation and destruction of jobs that produces these net annual figures is far more dramatic looking at data from individual manufacturing plants from 1973 to 1988 they found that in a typical 12 month period 10 3 per cent of jobs disappeared while another 9 1 per cent were newly created while us workers have been finding jobs their earnings adjusted for inflation have fared worse average weekly earnings in the private sector measured in 1982 dollars climbed from dollars 261 92 in 1960 to dollars 315 38 in 1973 since then they have slipped back steadily to only dollars 255 99 at the end of 1993 within this overall decline workers in the highest wages bracket saw their earnings rise by an average of 4 4 per cent in real terms over the last 20 years while workers in the bottom wage bracket saw a real fall in earnings of 10 3 per cent another census bureau study published last week shows that 18 per cent of america s 81m full time workers earned less than a poverty level wage of dollars 13 091 a year compared with only 12 per cent in 1979 some european countries while they may not have escaped the erosion of real wages have avoided this increase in inequality this does not just mean that the superior record of job creation in the us has come entirely in low wage low skill sectors such as fast food restaurants the us economy has not been producing mcjobs disproportionately says ms laura tyson chair of the white house council of economic advisers we have been creating jobs in good job classification categories but that rate of growth of compensation of those jobs has slowed some of the pressure on earnings has come from the spiralling cost of health insurance which is provided in most cases by employers who generally pass on around 80 per cent of the costs to their workers in lower wages but even measures of total compensation including health benefits have grown at a rate the clinton administration finds disappointing the question ministers will address today and tomorrow is in the words of mr robert reich us labour secretary are the citizens of advanced economies condemned to choose between on the one hand more jobs which pay less and less or good jobs but high levels of unemployment accompanying those good jobs i think there s a third choice and that third choice may be to combine the kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship that we find in europe with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we find in the us all encased within macro economic policies which encourage growth and jobs
