FT941-4004	ft 14 mar 94 envoys near critical stage in hunt for bosnian peace us and russia anxious to begin drawing up maps	the us and russia now co ordinating every move in the search for peace in the former yugoslavia want to resolve one of the more intractable aspects of a settlement for bosnia the maps after three days of negotiations in vienna zagreb and sarajevo mr charles redman the us special envoy and mr vitaly churkin his russian counterpart are reaching a critical stage in negotiations over bosnia s future us and un officials said that if the bosnian serbs could not be brought on board to join the complex federation of bosnia s moslems and croats the draft constitution of which was agreed by the two former adversaries in vienna yesterday then the bosnian serbs would have to decide whether to cede land in return for peace otherwise they added the bosnian serbs could find themselves in a limbo with their territory the search for a settlement intensified over the weekend when general john galvin the former supreme commander of nato helped forge a defence agreement between bosnia s croats and moslems leading to the establishment of one bosnian army us officials stressed this would not provide the means for a new offensive against the bosnian serbs its aim is to stop the fighting between croats and moslems it is also the first step towards creation of a federation in one part of bosnia a us official said after talks in zagreb the croatian capital mr churkin said he would not rule out serb participation in the federation even mr momcilo krajisnik speaker of the bosnian serbs self proclaimed parliament and an important negotiator said serbs were willing to join peace talks or some some kind of co existence with moslems and croats within bosnia in sarajevo bosnian serb and moslems said they had set up a preliminary agreement to open up to civilian traffic routes in and out of the bosnian capital this could be the beginning of the lifting of the siege and an eventual demilitarisation of the city mr churkin who met bosnian president alija izetbegovic in sarajevo yesterday will today hold talks with serb leaders in belgrade the serbian capital us officials said the talks could pave the way for an overall peace settlement for bosnia and croatia mr churkin must establish today whether president slobodan milosevic of serbia is ready to sue for peace which would lead to the lifting of sanctions any moves towards peace would require belgrade persuading the bosnian serbs who hold nearly 70 per cent of bosnia to reduce their control to about 49 per cent during the bosnian croat and moslem talks hosted by the us in vienna maps have not been discussed for the federation as any decisions would have to involve negotiations with the bosnian serbs sections of the bosnian serb leadership are loath to cede any land it would mean breaking the fragile territorial corridors linking serbs living in krajina south western croatia to bosnian serb territory and ultimately to serbia proper it is difficult to know if the links between milosevic and the krajina serbs are weaker than those between the bosnian serbs and krajina a un negotiator said milosevic has to decide if he is prepared to weaken those links with krajina in return for sanctions being lifted equally the bosnian serbs must recognise they have no legitimacy as a self proclaimed state if they do not negotiate he added but the overriding consideration with regard to the status and fate of the krajina serbs is the extent to which they can be used as pawns by belgrade in the hunt for a settlement with croatia and bosnia the future status krajina holds is the linchpin for peace between croatia and serbia a un peace negotiator said croatia wants full control of its territory including krajina but the krajina serbs do not want to live in croatia regardless of pressure from belgrade they are the achilles heel despite this bosnian serbs and mr milosevic continue to hold a strong negotiating position they can argue that the federation of bosnian croats and moslems will be linked to croatia through a confederation in effect creating an eventual greater croatia and rewarding croat gains in western hercegovina consequently they can ask why the bosnian serbs in eastern bosnian cannot link to serbia proper the answer is that the us wants to maintain a semblance of bosnia s territorial integrity but we know that under a new guise and with haggling over the maps bosnia is already being carved up between zagreb and belgrade a un official said
