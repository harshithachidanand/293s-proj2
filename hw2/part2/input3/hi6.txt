FT941-4001	ft 14 mar 94 international press review	madrid spain s socialist government has found itself in a role it wanted badly to avoid as the villain of the piece or as they say in spanish the bad guy in the film over enlargement of the european union but by evoking national interests it has ensured a broad front of support from the country s press most editorialists gave less importance to the wrangle with norway over fishing rights than spain s demands for minority blocking votes in the future 16 member eu the leading madrid daily el pais described spain s decision to dig its heels in as unfortunate but right at stake was spain s ability to prevent decisions on crucial issues being imposed on it the argument boiled down to a struggle to prevent europe s centre of gravity being definitively shifted northwards it recognised the quandary this represented for spain s ostensibly pro european leaders for some negotiators it is hard to resist the pressure and criticism from friends partners and allies but in this instance there is no other way for spain which favours enlargement to defend interests of the first magnitude the right wing daily abc said the government s firmness was backed by all political parties but the government itelf was partly to blame for the terrible way it negotiated spain s entry eight years ago leaving the country in many sectors defenceless against a decision by brussels as for norwegian cod it hoped for a logical outcome which would cater for spain s legitimate demands without imposing intolerable conditions on norway the conservative barcelona newspaper la vanguardia commented anyone shocked by spain s attitude should also be shocked by the attitude of those opposing its demands norway it conceded was perfectly entitled to defend its interests the difference was that the norwegians were on the outside trying to get in paris air france s request for ffr20bn pounds 2 3bn in state aid and the fact that it accounted for half the losses made by all the world s airlines last year occupied much space but provoked relatively little editorial comment in the french press one exception however was la tribune the business daily which said that some would find it scandalous that the french taxpayer was having to dig into his pocket again to save air france and bull the computer company and others would reckon that the bills presented by the new bosses of these companies were a bit steep even indecent at a time when private companies were having to take the risk of going to the markets for new money the distortion of competition was too flagrant not to be noticed said la tribune in language that could have come and undoubtedly will out of a british airways press release on the air france aid request but the real problem la tribune said was that air france and bull had simply always lived sheltered lives protected from the market and winds of competition their recent history was a tale of money lost energies wasted and employees disappointed however ouest france produced in bordeaux but with the largest circulation in france struck a more upbeat note mr christian blanc air france s new boss had a record of solving knotty problems like the new caledonian crisis in the 1980s and other french companies like citroen had been able to pull themselves rapidly together but it said air france s problem was that it essentially lacked a business culture and that will not be settled by a cheque santiago weekend papers were glowing in their accounts of the presidential handover a fiesta of democracy in which eduardo frei in the words of la nacion arrived in valparaiso home to congress as a common citizen and returned to santiago as president for the most part editors forgot their political differences and treated the event as pageant this was after all as la epoca pointed out the first time in nearly 25 years that power had been transferred from one democratically elected president to another the last time was in 1970 when eduardo frei s father handed the presidential sash to salvador allende the man responsible for breaking that sequence general augusto pinochet attended frei s inauguration in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces according to el mercurio the general s entrance was received with loud and prolonged applause la epoca noticed that after the ceremony the general did not exit through the front door but left via the car parks there was much praise for outgoing president patricio aylwin though an opinion piece in la tercera thought his government had not properly administered what it had received from its military predecessor el mercurio said that discounting financial scandal at state copper company codelco and a lax attitude towards crime aylwin s presidency had been one of the most auspicious in the country s history it hoped president frei a fellow christian democrat would show the same moderation la nacion was less cautious in a piece headlined four unforgettable years it said the historical merit of aylwin is that he taught us to live in a democracy once again now that chileans were not fighting for basic political freedoms they could concentrate on social problems it said four years ago it was not like that contributions from david white madrid david buchan paris david pilling santiago
