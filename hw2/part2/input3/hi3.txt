FT941-3998	ft 14 mar 94 us and europe reach rare consensus all agree on need for greater labour flexibility	an unusual consensus has emerged at least between the us and europe from the dozens of papers produced by governments and think tanks for the group of seven jobs summit which is to begin in detroit today even if there has been no new big idea for solving the developed world s unemployment problem the three main voices in the debate the us the uk and the continental european backed by economists at the organisation for economic co operation and development are all emphasising a combination of greater labour market flexibility easier enterprise formation more effective active labour market measures and improvements in education and training there is even a broad consensus around one of the central causes of unemployment in the developed world that a combination of trade with developing countries and technological change has permanently reduced demand for less skilled labour benefit systems and minimum wages put a floor under unskilled wages in europe so the fall in demand has shown in rising unemployment in the us on the other hand the problem is expressed in falling wages or resort to crime the policy challenge is to move as many people as possible into high skill jobs while ensuring that labour markets are flexible enough to soak up the rest without forcing down incomes too far by their attendance at the summit all g7 countries implicitly accept that social engineering to deal with this collapse in demand for unskilled labour and to cut the time lag between the destruction of old jobs and the creation of new ones is justified in political terms both free market liberals represented most strongly by the uk government and social christian democrats represented by continental europe and the european commission can sign to such a combination of ideas a democratic administration in the us interested in european welfare and training systems but still wedded to many aspects of its own flexible labour market hovers between the two but the idea of mid atlantic convergence can also be misleading because the meeting point is far closer to the us than to the european coast indeed the starting point of the most influential analysis is considerably more liberal and competitiveness conscious than a decade ago the emphasis in europe is on repairing the poor capacity of its economies to create new jobs in the us which has produced 2m new jobs in the past 18 months the emphasis is on producing higher skilled higher paid jobs all the main parties to the debate including the traditionally orthodox oecd are also careful to avoid advocating us style wage differentials and real wage cuts in 1972 1992 us average real wages fell by about 10 per cent even the uk government the strongest admirer of the us model talks about the balance to be struck between market forces and regulation the main clusters of ideas on the detroit agenda are wage and regulatory flexibility the oecd has long advocated that europe increase its labour cost flexibility and reform its job security provisions the most surprising recent convert to this orthodoxy has been the european commission the european commission s white paper on growth competitiveness and employment published at the end of last year talks about a new solidarity between the employed and the unemployed and about remodelled regulation rather than de regulation but it pulls few punches on the problems of european rigidity it says that many social protection schemes and wage bargaining systems have had a negative impact on employment protecting those in work at the expense of job seekers and says that there is broad consensus from member states on the need for greater flexibility and lower labour costs the most concrete policy proposal to create more jobs for the less skilled and increase the employment intensity of the services sector is to increase the burden of non wage labour costs as incomes rise at present the proportion falls as incomes rise in most european countries the us paper circulated to governments before the summit also stresses that the main policy requirement for europe and japan is to reduce restrictions on wage setting and employment adjustment which reduce the incentives of the unemployed to find jobs and the incentives of employers to create them training education and good jobs the us paper says that in the right climate of innovation and entrepreneurship new technology creates as many jobs as it destroys but if all citizens are to qualify for these jobs the standards of basic education and training must be improved especially in the us and the school to work transition must be better handled active labour markets and more flexible welfare the annual cost of unemployment in the eu including foregone income is more than ecu200bn pounds 151bn each year greater than the gdp of belgium in recent years there has been a small shift towards active labour market measures training job placement and so on but more than two thirds of direct spending on unemployment still goes on passive measures the challenge is to find ways of boosting the incomes of the unskilled in a more economically efficient manner than just leaving them on benefits the problem is that europe s social security systems were designed on the assumption of full time employment and have failed to adapt to the growth of part time and atypical employment individuals find it difficult to move from unemployment into anything other than full time work because of the steep claw back of benefits disagreements and other views there are of course differences of emphasis between the main participants with most european countries playing down cyclical factors and playing up structural factors while the us still believes that a good part of the unemployment problem is linked to low growth countries which pursue structural improvements without taking steps to increase aggregate demand will see little or no return for their efforts warns the us paper japan with the best record of any g7 country on jobs in recent years also warns in its otherwise orthodox paper against too much emphasis on labour flexibility excessive mobility of workers discourages incentives to enhance human resource development by enterprises it warns one idea not on the detroit agenda which runs strongly counter to economic orthodoxy is work sharing the eu white paper was ambivalent about it rejecting a generalised reduction in working hours and job sharing at national level even so as a preferable alternative to widespread redundancies for companies in short term trouble reduced working time will remain on the broader agenda
